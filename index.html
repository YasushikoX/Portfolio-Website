        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            Greetings! My name is Jake, and I'm a dedicated Python developer with a keen interest in robotics and 3D printing. 
            As a developer, I have created a variety of applications, including a custom Discord bot that facilitates finding and connecting with teammates with ease.
            I am also proud of my work designing and building a functional robotic arm, which required a mix of programming and mechanical engineering skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a wealth of experience in 3D printing and creating things in general, and I'm highly skilled in using software like Fusion 360 to design and manufacture intricate parts for a wide range of projects. 
            The limitless possibilities of this technology have always fascinated me, and I'm constantly on the lookout for new and innovative ways to apply it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's designing a new product or building a complex mechanism, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible. 
            I'm fascinated by the intersection of creativity and technology, and I believe that with the right tools and mindset, anything is possible.

                I knew from the moment I received that guitar that music was going to be a significant part of my life. Since then, I've made it a daily practice to play the guitar, and I've immersed myself in music through several bands and music courses

To my surprise, I was awarded the red diploma, which signaled the highest grade achievable in the competition. In fact, there were only three diplomas available: red, blue, and green.
                   The red diploma was considered the best grade, so I was incredibly proud of my accomplishment. Winning that competition not only boosted my confidence but also sparked my passion for math, which has stayed with me ever since.

                However, getting accepted into this school was no easy feat. It was the second best math school in Odessa, and there were roughly 50 applicants competing for each spot. Nevertheless, I managed to secure a spot and was even accepted into a math-focused class.

                After six years of swimming, I began to feel burnt out and decided to explore other sports. I was torn between basketball and tennis, but ultimately chose to pursue tennis. Once I made the switch, I started playing every day and participating in various camps and tournaments. 
                Although it was challenging, I was determined to improve and eventually climbed to the 49th spot in the Ukrainian rankings. One memorable victory came when I defeated the previous holder of that ranking with a score of 6-2.

I couldn't believe it - I was thrilled to have the opportunity to attend such a renowned institution and to experience a new culture in a new country. It was an exhilarating prospect for me.
                 I ended up attending the school for a year and it was an unforgettable experience, even though I had to leave due to the outbreak of war. This wasn't my first time being alone in a foreign country, as I had started attending music courses and other camps in United Kingdom by myself when I was just 10 years old.

                 It was a fun experience, and I quickly got involved in extracurricular activities such as the FRC. With plenty of free time on my hands, I was able to concentrate on my projects more and make progress towards achieving my goals.

                In 2022, I embarked on my first significant programming project, which was to create a Discord bot in Python. The bot was designed to help gamers find new friends who shared their interests. Essentially, it worked like Badoo or Tinder, but was integrated within Discord and aimed at gamers. Developing this bot was a considerable challenge, primarily due to the complexity of the discord.py library.
                 However, during the development process, I gained a significant amount of knowledge and skills, including learning how to use databases and host apps on servers. This project was a massive milestone for me, being my first significant programming undertaking, and I am proud of what I achieved.
